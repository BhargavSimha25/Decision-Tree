# Decision Trees in Machine Learning 🌳

Welcome to the **Decision Trees in Machine Learning** repository! This project provides comprehensive resources and tools for understanding, implementing, and optimizing decision tree algorithms. Decision trees are a powerful tool for both classification and regression tasks.

## 📚 Overview

Decision trees are a popular machine learning algorithm used for decision-making based on features of the data. They work by splitting the data into subsets based on feature values, creating a tree-like model of decisions and their possible consequences. This repository covers the fundamentals, practical implementations, and advanced techniques related to decision trees.
